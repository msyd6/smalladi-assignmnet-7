1. New Additions to the Webpage
This assignment extends the previous work by adding functionalities for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. Here’s a breakdown of the new additions:

Data Generation Inputs: In addition to previous inputs, users can now specify:
Intercept (β₀) and Slope (β₁) of the regression line.
These values are used in data generation, following the formula:

Hypothesis Testing Section:
Users can perform hypothesis tests on the slope or intercept of the regression line after data generation.
Options include:
Parameter to Test: Slope or Intercept.
Type of Test: Greater than (>), Less than (<), or Not equal to (≠).
The application calculates a p-value for the hypothesis test, displaying whether the observed slope or intercept is statistically significant based on the user’s input.
Confidence Interval Section:
Users can calculate confidence intervals for the slope or intercept after data generation.
Options include:
Parameter for Confidence Interval: Slope or Intercept.
Confidence Level: 90%, 95%, or 99%.
The application calculates the confidence interval using the simulated slopes and intercepts.
